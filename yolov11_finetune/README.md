# Fine-tuning YOLOv11 on the nuScenes Dataset (Planned)

> **Note:** Fine-tuning YOLOv11 on the nuScenes dataset is a planned feature for this repository, but is **not yet implemented**. The following documentation outlines the intended process and requirements for when this feature becomes available.

## Overview
This repository is not primarily focused on YOLOv11 fine-tuning, but will support it as an additional feature in the future. Implementation details and scripts for fine-tuning will be added in upcoming updates.

## Directory Contents
- `finetune_yolov11.py`: Script scaffold for the fine-tuning pipeline (to be implemented).
- `config.yaml`: Sample configuration for fine-tuning (edit for dataset paths and hyperparameters).

## Planned Steps
- Prepare the nuScenes dataset and ensure it is organized as required.
- Update configuration files to specify dataset paths and training parameters.
- Implement training scripts to support YOLOv11 fine-tuning.
- Provide monitoring and evaluation tools for the fine-tuning process.

## Current Status
- **YOLOv11 fine-tuning is not yet implemented.**
- Please check back for updates or contribute to the development if interested.
